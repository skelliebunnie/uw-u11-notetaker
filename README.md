## Installing
- run ```git clone``` to make a local copy of the project
- run ```npm install``` to install packages

*A demo db.json file has been included, with sample notes. You can clear the file or delete it. If it's deleted, it will automatically be recreated when you save your first note.*

## Usage
run ```node server.js``` (or ```nodemon server.js```) to run the app. Enter a title for your note, and any text you want for the note "body". You will not be able to save a note until the title has at least one (1) character. You do not need to enter any text in the "body". To save, click the save icon in the header nav on the right. The pencil will open a new note. Clicking on the the title of a previously saved note will display the note - which will be editable - in the note area on the right. Click the red trash icon to delete the corresponding note.
